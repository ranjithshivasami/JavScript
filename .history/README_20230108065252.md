### map(), filter() and reduce() functions
    The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

    The map() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array and constructs a new array from the results.
 #### Syntax
    // Arrow function
    map((element) => { /* … */ })

    // Callback function
    map(callbackFn)

    map(function (element) { /* … */ })
